Japan has long been a global economic power. In September 2020, Shinzo Abe resigned as prime minister, having set a record as the longest-serving Japanese leader. His successor, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, lasted only a year before declining to seek reelection. Former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida was elected in October 2021 vowing to maintain Japan’s foreign and security policies. Suga was heavily criticized for Japan’s slow response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Kishida faces an improved COVID situation and is vowing to implement strong fiscal stimulus measures to reinvigorate Japan’s sluggish economy. The public wants strong reforms to remedy Japan’s endemic economic problems but fears the upheaval that such measures could cause.
